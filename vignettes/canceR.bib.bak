The query interface combined with customized data storage enables researchers to interactively explore genetic alterations across samples, genes, and pathways and, when available in the underlying data, to link these to clinical outcomes. The portal provides graphical summaries of gene-level data from multiple platforms, network visualization and analysis, survival analysis, patient-centric queries, and software programmatic access. The intuitive Web interface of the portal makes complex cancer genomics profiles accessible to researchers and clinicians without requiring bioinformatics expertise, thus facilitating biological discoveries.

Together with the seamless connection between the powerful computational and visual environment in R, circlize gives users more convenience and freedom to design figures for better understanding genomic patterns behind multi-dimensional data.circlize is available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/circlize/},

Using molecular profiles of >3,000 tumors from 11 human cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we systematically analyzed expression of miRNAs and mRNAs across cancer types to infer recurrent cancer-associated miRNA-target relationships. As we expected, the inferred relationships were consistent with sequence-based predictions and published data from miRNA perturbation experiments. Notably, miRNAs with recurrent target relationships were frequently regulated by genetic and epigenetic alterations across the studied cancer types. We also identify new examples of miRNAs that coordinately regulate cancer pathways, including the miR-29 family, which recurrently regulates active DNA demethylation pathway members TET1 and TDG. The online resource http://cancerminer.org allows exploration and prioritization of miRNA-target interactions that potentially regulate tumorigenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {DNA microarrays provide for unprecedented large-scale views of gene expression and, as a result, have emerged as a fundamental measurement tool in the study of diverse biological systems. Statistical questions abound, but many traditional data analytic approaches do not apply, in large part because thousands of individual genes are measured with relatively little replication. Empirical Bayes methods provide a natural approach to microarray data analysis because they can significantly reduce the dimensionality of an inference problem while compensating for relatively few replicates by using information across the array. We propose a general empirical Bayes modelling approach which allows for replicate expression profiles in multiple conditions. The hierarchical mixture model accounts for differences among genes in their average expression levels, differential expression for a given gene among cell types, and measurement fluctuations. Two distinct parameterizations are considered: a model based on Gamma distributed measurements and one based on log-normally distributed measurements. False discovery rate and related operating characteristics of the methodology are assessed in a simulation study. We also show how the posterior odds of differential expression in one version of the model is related to the ratio of the arithmetic mean to the geometric mean of the two sample means. The methodology is used in a study of mammary cancer in the rat, where four distinct patterns of expression are possible.},

Individual residuals, grouped or aggregated by chromosomal loci, indicate problematic samples and potential data-entry errors, and help identify hyperdiploidy as a factor playing a key role in expression for this dataset. Subsequent analysis pinpoints suspected DNA copy number abnormalities of specific samples and chromosomes (most prevalent are chromosomes X, 21 and 14), and also reveals significant expression differences between the hyperdiploid and diploid groups on other chromosomes (most prominently 19, 22, 3 and 13)--differences which are apparently not associated with copy number.Software for the statistical tools demonstrated in this article is available as Bioconductor package GSEAlm.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract                 = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

  Abstract                 = {limmaGUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) based on R-Tcl/Tk for the exploration and linear modeling of data from two-color spotted microarray experiments, especially the assessment of differential expression in complex experiments. limmaGUI provides an interface to the statistical methods of the limma package for R, and is itself implemented as an R package. The software provides point and click access to a range of methods for background correction, graphical display, normalization, and analysis of microarray data. Arbitrarily complex microarray experiments involving multiple RNA sources can be accomodated using linear models and contrasts. Empirical Bayes shrinkage of the gene-wise residual variances is provided to ensure stable results even when the number of arrays is small. Integrated support is provided for quantitative spot quality weights, control spots, within-array replicate spots and multiple testing. limmaGUI is available for most platforms on the which R runs including Windows, Mac and most flavors of Unix.http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/limmaGUI.},
